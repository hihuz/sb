        "After studying computer science at Paul Sabatier university in Toulouse, I found (about 6 years ago) a job as programmer for Harris Interactive (now a part of Toluna group), a market research company based in Paris. It was a whole new life and experience for me to work there and live in Paris.",
        "About 3 years ago, I had an opportunity to come back to my home town of Toulouse (following my partner who was starting new studies there), and I kept working for the same company remotely for about 2 years as a \"Technical consultant\" (not that the title really matters). While working there, I acquired a strong experience in front-end web development, but also in project management, mentorship, contractors handling, and more.",
        "Last year I felt it was time for a change and I had the exciting opportunity to join Occitech as a web developer where I have been working mainly on a product called Front-Commerce whose goal is to drastically improve the way e-commerce sites are built by providing a pluggable and modern front-end layer (a GraphQL middleware and a React SPA/PWA)  on top of existing e-commerce solutions. I have learned a lot working on this ambitious project along with the Occitech team.",
        "I am very enthusiastic and curious in general, but particularly about programming. I love learning new things and challenging what I know and learn. The pace at which front-end technologies have been evolving these past few years make them a very good fit for me. This is not to say that I don't enjoy other aspects of programming, and I am always open to new opportunities."

        "Even though most of my paid work can't be showcased, I really like using some of my free time to hack on personal projects, and try my hand at technologies that I find interesting. Most of them will be on github, and some recent examples can be seen below."
